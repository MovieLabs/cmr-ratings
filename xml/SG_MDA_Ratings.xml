      Applies to a film, music compilation, karaoke or serial.
      <p>VOD and OTT services offering content rated NC16 and above are required to offer a parental lock feature that allows subscribers to limit the access of such content to their children. To further ensure children are not accidentally exposed to Restricted 21 (R21) content on VOD and OTT, such programmes must be locked by default and can only be accessed by entering an R21 PIN.</p>

    <mdcr:Definition>Theme and Message</mdcr:Definition>
    <mdcr:Explanation>
      <div class="userHtml">Classification must take into account the treatment of theme(s) and message(s)
in a film. For the advisory ratings, theme(s) and message(s) should be
presented and treated sensitively due to the potential impact on the young.
Films that center on mature theme(s) or content would generally be classified
NC16, M18 or R21. Films that contain distorted or misrepresented discussions
or depictions of a subject matter (including historical events), may be classified
at a higher rating or refused classification.</div>

    <mdcr:Definition>Violence</mdcr:Definition>
    <mdcr:Explanation>
      <div class="userHtml">The degree and nature of violence in a film will impact the classification rating.
Depictions of violence may frighten, unsettle or invite imitation, especially from
children. Therefore, only mild depictions of violence may be allowed in films
meant for children. For the higher ratings, stronger depictions of violence are
permitted. However, films that contain detailed or gratuitous depictions of
extreme violence or cruelty; detailed instructions on methods of crime or killings;
or excessive or exploitative depictions of sexual violence will be refused
classification.</div>

      <div class="userHtml">The extent and context of depictions of nudity are classification considerations.
There should be no nudity at a G rating. At a PG or PG13 rating, depictions of
rear or side profile nudity in a non-sexual context may be presented. There can
be exceptions for films which feature infrequent and non-sexual depictions of
female upper body nudity at a PG13 rating, e.g. films containing footage of
historical events, tribal ways of life, or medical/health programmes. Upper body
frontal nudity in a non-sexual context is allowed under NC16. Depictions of full
frontal nudity may be featured at M18 or R21. Exploitative depictions of nudity
will be refused classification.</div>

    <mdcr:Definition>Sex</mdcr:Definition>
    <mdcr:Explanation>
      <div class="userHtml">
        <p>Classification of depictions of sexual activity in films depends on its explicitness,
frequency, and relevance to the storyline. Generally, there should be no
depictions of sexual activity at the G and PG ratings.</p>
        <p>Films that depict alternative sexualities, e.g. homosexuality, should be sensitive
to community values. Films that centre on alternative sexualities may be
classified at highest rating of R21. Non-explicit depictions of sexual activity
between persons of the same gender may be featured at R21 rating.</p>
        <p>Films containing depictions of sexual activities such as sadomasochism,
bondage, orgies or sexual violence will be subject to strict review and may only
be allowed at the higher ratings, depending on the treatment and context.</p>
        <p>Films containing explicit depictions of deviant sexual activities (e.g. paedophilia,
bestiality and necrophilia) or exploitative depictions of sexual activities will be
refused classification.</p>

    <mdcr:Explanation>
      <div class="userHtml">
        <p>The classification of coarse language depends on the strength of the language,
the context in which it is used, as well as community and cultural sensitivities
associated with its usage.</p>
        <p>Coarse language, rude gestures, and gestures with sexual connotations must
not be featured in G films as they are easily imitated by young children. In PG13
films, there may be infrequent use of expletives such as ‘f**k’.</p>
        <p>Stronger language is acceptable at higher ratings, with due consideration given
to the degree of offensiveness and frequency of usage. This includes coarse
language that offends community and cultural sensitivities.</p>
        <p>Chinese films meant for theatrical release should generally be in Mandarin, in
line with the Speak Mandarin Campaign. Films with dialect content are allowed
on a case-by-case basis.</p>

abuse. Films rated PG and PG13 may only feature infrequent or discreet
references or depictions of drug and substance abuse, as these may have a
negative influence on the young. Depictions of drug and substance abuse may
be featured at NC16, M18 or R21, depending on the frequency and level of
details. Films with content that promote drug or psychoactive substance abuse,
or includes detailed and instructive depictions of drug or psychoactive
substance abuse will be refused classification.</div>
